# Node.js & MySQL
### Matt McIntyre

## Objective
In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

### Challenge #1: Customer View

1. Create a MySQL Database called `bamazon`.
2. Then create a Table inside of that database called `products`.
3. The products table should have each of the following columns:
   * item_id (unique id for each product)
   * product_name (Name of product)
   * department_name
   * price (cost to customer)
   * stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)
4. Populate this database with around 10 different products. (i.e. Insert "mock" data rows into this database and table).
